### info regarding the commits -> the first commit in this repository is [transferred the built compoennts from an old repo to this now one](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/ramadanhabitstracker/commit/78b8fdcb5ec26c82eb4347546377a27ee2184a49) where I copied some of the components used in an [older repo](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/ramadanhabitstracking), but that old one is archived now because somehow <b>VERCEL</b> had some building issues with module paths import but everything worked just fine in local build so i had to raise an issue/move to another new repo to carry off this project
